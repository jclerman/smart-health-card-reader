# Smart Health Card Parser

Library for basic parsing of Smart Health Card data,
particularly demonstrating how to read the data
in Smart Health Card QR codes like the ones being
supplied by the California Dept. of Health to support
electronic verification of COVID-19 vaccination status 
([link](https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/)).

Partly recapitulates the demonstration at 
[smarthealth.cards](https://demo-portals.smarthealth.cards/VerifierPortal.html).
